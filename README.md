 CipherByte Technologies Projects

This repository contains the projects assigned to me by CipherByte Technologies as part of my responsibilities. The projects included in this repository are:

## 1. Iris Flower Classification

The Iris Flower Classification project is a demonstration of machine learning techniques applied to classify iris flowers into their respective species. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) along with their corresponding species (setosa, versicolor, virginica). The project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques.

## 2. Unraveling Unemployment

The Unraveling Unemployment project is a data analysis project focused on exploring and understanding unemployment trends. It involves analyzing a dataset containing information about unemployment rates across different demographics, regions, and time periods. The project aims to uncover insights and patterns within the data to better understand the factors influencing unemployment and inform policy decisions.
