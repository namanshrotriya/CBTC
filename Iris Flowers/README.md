# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project is a demonstration of iris flower classification using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) along with their corresponding species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

## Description

In this project, I utilize the popular Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms. I employed the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification, a simple yet powerful technique in machine learning. The model learns from the features of iris flowers and predicts their species based on similarities with neighboring data points in the feature space.

Additionally, I created insightful visualizations to gain insights into the dataset and model performance. These visualizations include histogram plots to visualize the distribution of Sepal Length and Petal Width by species.

## Uses

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, model training, and visualization techniques. It provides valuable learning experience in:

- Data preprocessing: Handling and cleaning datasets.
- Machine learning model training: Training a KNN classifier for multi-class classification.
- Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
- Data visualization: Creating informative visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
